Featherₜₛ is a small component framework written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 
Whether you are writing embeddable javascript widgets or a single page application this framework 
might be of use. With less than 8kb in size it is suited for mobile apps and desktop alike.
It is especially well suited for the consumption of restful services.

The framework offers the following features:

* Each component is holding logic, view and model in a single file
* Components automatically build a hierarchical tree
* Message hub between components
* REST access
* Routing via hash or history API 
* Very flat learning curve due
* Logicless templates in pure HTML with very simple binding syntax
* Event delegation out of the box
* Written in TypeScript
* No module loaders needed, embed directly via NPM
* With aynchronous decorators no need for _promises_
* Support for modern browsers including IE9
  
You can checkout a todomvc demo [here](http://todo.feather-ts.com).
  
{{< note title="Note" >}}
This project is in its infancy, so if you want something production ready, you
should probably check out react, angular or any of the myriad of MVC frameworks out there with way
better documenation and community support than feather will ever have.

As soon as the framework is stable enough to be released to the public I will disclose the github repository. 
Right now it is just work in progress, thus use it at your own risk. If you find any problems feel free to 
drop me an [email](mailto:mendrik76@gmail.com).
